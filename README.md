# Kidney-Disease-Classification
In this project, we have performed preprocessing and classification on a dataset taken from <a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Chronic_Kidney_Disease" >here</a>. This dataset is collected from hospitals over a period of two months and it can be used to predict the chronic kidney disease.

## How to run
Download the ipynb file from the repository and open google colab and run :-)
